      <p>A class is like a template or blueprint that tells JavaScript how to make an object. The object will have some properties (things it can have) and methods (things it can do).</p>
      <p>For example :- let's imagine we're making cars. We want to make a bunch of cars, and each car has a color and a model, and each car can drive and stop.</p>

    <h2>Creating a Car Class</h2>
    <span>EXAMPLE :- </span>
        // This is the Car blueprint (class)
        class Car {
            // The constructor is like a "setup" function that creates a new car
            constructor(color, model) {
                this.color = color;   // This car has a color
                this.model = model;   // This car has a model
            }

            // This is a function (method) that tells the car to drive
            drive() {
                console.log(`${this.model} is driving!`);
            }

            // This is another function (method) that tells the car to stop
            stop() {
                console.log(`${this.model} has stopped.`);
            }
        }

        // Now we use the class to create (make) a new car
        let myCar = new Car("red", "Toyota");  // This is a red Toyota

        // We can use the methods of this car
        myCar.drive();  // Output: Toyota is driving!
        myCar.stop();   // Output: Toyota has stopped.

        <h5>Explaination</h5>
        <ul>
         <li>
          class Car { ... } is the blueprint. It says what a car can do (like drive and stop) and what a car has (like color and model).
        </li>
        <li>
         constructor(color, model) is where we set up the car when we make it. We give it a color and model when we create a car.
        </li>
        <li>Methods like drive() and stop() are actions that the car can do.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Summary of Basic JavaScript Class Concepts:</h2>
    Class: A template (blueprint) for creating objects.
    Constructor: The special function inside the class that sets up the object.
    Properties: Things an object has, like color or model.
    Methods: Things an object can do, like drive or stop.
