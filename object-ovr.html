    <h1>JS OBJECTS</h1>
	<div class="Real Life Objects">
	In real life, objects are things like: houses, cars, people, animals, or any other subjects.

	Here is a car object example:

	Car Object	Properties	         Methods
		
				car.name = Fiat      car.start()

				car.model = 500      car.drive()

				car.weight = 850kg   car.brake()

				car.color = white	 car.stop()
	
	</div>
	
	<div class="js objects">
	Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.

    This code assigns many values (Fiat, 500, white) to an object named car:
	
	<p>EXAMPLE: Creating an Object</p>
	
	<code>
	// Create an Object:
	const car = {
     	type:"Fiat", 
		model:"500", 
		color:"white"
	};

	// Display Data from the Object:
	console.log("The car type is " + car.type);
	console.log("The car type is " + car.model);
	console.log("The car type is " + car.type);
	console.log("The car type is " + car.type);
	<code>

	 >> Using an Object Literal
	 >>	Using the new Keyword

	 <h3>JS Object Literal</h3>
	 An object literal is a list of name:value pairs inside curly braces {}.

     Example: {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"}
	 
	 NOTE: name:value pairs are also called key:value pairs.
	       object literals are also called object initializers.
		   For readability, simplicity and execution speed, use the object literal method.
		   
	<p>EXAMPLE: Using an Object Literal</p>
	
	<code>
	// Create an empty Object
	const person = {};

	// Add Properties
	person.firstName = "John";
	person.lastName = "Doe";
	person.age = 50;
	person.eyeColor = "blue"; 

    // Display Data from the Object:
	console.log(person.firstName + " is " + person.age + " years old" + person.eyeColor);
	<code>
	
	
	<h3>Using JS new Keyword</h3>
	
	<p>EXAMPLE: JS object using new Object()</p>
	
	<code>
	// Create an Object
	const person = new Object();

	// Add Properties
	person.firstName = "John";
	person.lastName = "Doe";
	person.age = 50;
	person.eyeColor = "blue"; 

    // Display Data from the Object:
	console.log(person.firstName + " is " + person.age + " years old" + person.eyeColor);
	<code>
	</div>
	
	
	<div class="object Properties">
	<h3>Object Properties</h3>
    <p>The named values, in JavaScript objects, are called properties.</p>
	
    EXAMPLE:- PROPERTY	  VALUE
			  firstName	  John
			  lastName	  Doe
			  age	      50
			  eyeColor	  blue
	
	<h3>Accessing Object Properties</h3>
	<p>There are two ways to access a property: 
	   1.object.property 
	   2.object["property"]
	</p>
    </div>
	
	<div class="js object methods">
	<h4>JS Object Methods</h4>
	<p>Methods are actions that can be performed on objects.</p>
    <p>A Method is a function definition stored as a property value.</p>
	<code>
	// Create an Object:
	const car = {
		type:"Fiat", 
		model:"500", 
		color:"white",
		carfun: function(){
		  return(this.type); 
	  } 
	};
    // Display Function from an Object
	console.log(car.carfun());
	<code>
	In the example above, 'this' refers to the car object:

	 <h3>JS OBJECT CONCLUSION</h3>
	 <ul>
	   <li>Objects are containers for Properties and Methods.</li>
	   <li>Properties are named Values.</li>
	   <li>Methods are Functions stored as Properties.</li>
	   <li>Properties can be primitive values, functions, or even other objects.</li>
	 </ul>
	 <div class="js objects related">
	 In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object.
	 
		Objects are objects
		Maths are objects
		Functions are objects
		Dates are objects
		Arrays are objects
		Maps are objects
		Sets are objects
		
	All JavaScript values, except primitives, are objects.
	
	<h4>JavaScript Primitives</h4>
	
	A primitive value is a value that has no properties or methods.

	3.14 is a primitive value

	A primitive data type is data that has a primitive value.

	JavaScript defines 7 types of primitive data types:

	string
	number
	boolean
	null
	undefined
	symbol
	bigint
	
	<h4>Immutable</h4>
	
	Primitive values are immutable (they are hardcoded and cannot be changed).

	if x = 3.14, you can change the value of x, but you cannot change the value of 3.14.
	
	Value	     Type	          Comment
	"Hello"	    string	         "Hello" is always "Hello"
	3.14	    number	         3.14 is always 3.14
	true	    boolean	         true is always true
	false	    boolean	         false is always false
	null	    null (object)	 null is always null
	undefined	undefined	     undefined is always undefined
	
	<h4>Mutable</h4>
	
	Objects are mutable: They are addressed by reference, not by value.
    If person is an object, the following statement will not create a copy of person:
	
	<p>Example :- const x = person;</p>
	
	<p>EXAMPLE :- Objects are Mutable</p>
	<p>Changes to a copy of an object will also change the original object:</p>
	
	<code>
		// Create an Object:
		const car = {
			type:"Fiat", 
			model:"500", 
			color:"white",
			carfun: function(){
			  return(this.type); 
		  } 
		};
        // Create a Copy
		const x = car;
        // Change type
		x.type = "RANGEROVER"

		console.log(x.carfun());
